# Advent of Code 2021

This is just a repo to publish the code for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles ! Developed with [Squeak](https://squeak.org/) Smalltalk !

## Code
I will fileout the whole category/project each and every day.  I will use tags to identify up to which day the code represents.

## Puzzles

## Coding Style

I favor:

explicity over cryptic one-liners
meaningful variable names
code reuse
simplicity over wtf-does-that-code-do

Sure, I could just open a workspace & code the whole thing like a script & find the solution in a few lines.

But then, like it ALWAYS happens every year, I would have to resuse code (i.e. scripts) that isn't reusable!  Hence, I favor classes and good OO design over I-wanna-impress-people-with-my-fancy-scripts-in-a-workspace.  

P.S. I sometimes go back to previous days to refine the code, add comments, add class descriptions.  There's nothing like putting aside you code and come back to it a few days after and ask yourself "what is that supposed to do again?".  Usually a sign you need comments or something isn't crystal clear!
